A Visual Interface Wrapper for XMRig 

##Getting Started

Getting Started is easy download the code and build and add XMRig 0.8.0 to your debug or 
release folder, or download the precompiled versions from [Monero Resource Hub](https://sites.google.com/view/moneroresourcehub/resources/xmrigged)

##Prerequisites

Windows 7
x64 bit OS for GPU Mining and CPU Mining
x32 bit for CPU only

##Installing

Download the zip and run xmrigged (your Antivirus might give a false positive xmrig.exe mainly for the fact that its a miner and
could be used for malicious purposes)


##Built With

Visual Studios 2015
